============
Contributing
============

These practices are subject to change based on the decisions of the team.

- Use clear and explicit variable names.
- Python code should be formatted using black with the settings in ``pyproject.toml``. The maximum line length is 120 characters.
- Contributions should be commited to a new branch and will be merged with main only after tests and documentation are complete.


Testing
==================

- All tests must be passing before merging with the ``main`` branch.
- Tests are automatically included in the CI/CD pipeline using Github actions.

Git Commits
===========

We use the `git3moji <https://robinpokorny.github.io/git3moji/>`_ standard for expressive git commit messages. 
Use one of the following five short emojis at the start of your of your git commit messages:

- ``:zap:`` ‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äì Features and primary concerns
- ``:bug:`` üêõ ‚Äì Bugs and fixes
- ``:tv:``  üì∫ ‚Äì CI, tooling, and configuration
- ``:cop:`` üëÆ ‚Äì Tests and linting
- ``:abc:`` üî§ ‚Äì Documentation

As far as possible, please keep your git commits granular and focused on one thing at a time. 
Please cite an the number of a Github issue if it relates to your commit.

Documentation
==================

- Docstrings for Python functions should use the Google docstring convention (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Documentation should be generated using Sphinx and automatically deployed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Docs should be written in reStructuredText (``.rst``) format.

Files need to start with a heading for the section. The convention used here is to use the equals sign above and below the heading::

    ===============
    Section Heading
    ===============

Subsections also use an equals sign but just below the heading::

    Subsection Heading
    ==================

Subsubsections have a single dash below the heading::

    Subsubsection Heading
    ---------------------

Try not to have any other sections within this but if it is necessary, use tildes below the heading::
